                    <td class="output"><pre>I'll help you create a comprehensive meal plan for this athlete. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Daily Calorie Calculation:
   - Assuming moderate to high activity level
   - Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
     BMR = (10 × weight) + (6.25 × height) - (5 × age) + 5
     Assuming age 25: BMR ≈ 1,925 calories
   - Activity multiplier (training season): 1.7
   - Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE): 1,925 × 1.7 = 3,270 calories

2. Macronutrient Breakdown:
   - Protein: 2.2g per kg of body weight
     85 kg × 2.2 = 187g protein (748 calories)
   - Carbohydrates: 5-7g per kg of body weight
     85 kg × 6 = 510g carbs (2,040 calories)
   - Fats: Remaining calories
     3,270 - (748 + 2,040) = 482 calories (54g fat)

3. Meal Timing:
   - Pre-workout meal: Complex carbs, lean protein
   - Post-workout meal: High protein, quick-absorbing carbs
   - Meals spread 3-4 hours apart

4. Lactose-Free, Budget-Friendly Meal Plan:

Breakfast (7:00 AM) - 700 calories:
- Oatmeal (100g dry)
- Plant-based protein powder (30g)

- Fat: 54g

6. Budget Considerations:
- Bulk buying proteins (chicken, ground beef)
